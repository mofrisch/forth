: Opc(  ( k*x xt "<NNN> ..." -- )
  \G Append a new table row for an opcode with Operands.  Use your assembler
  \G operands to fill the MODES array with data showing how the opcode is
  \G used.  Only the types of operands are recorded, any operand parameters
  \G passed on the stack are dropped.  The opcode's instruction code is read
  \G as 8-bit numbers from the current input line and stored as counted string
  \G in the table's opcode column
  \G
  \G When assembling an instruction, the assembler checks for matching
  \G operands.  If this row matches, first XT is called to consume operands
  \G parameters from the stack and encode them into the instruction latch.
  \G Then the opcode column is ORed to the instruction latch and the assembler
  \G quits assembly of the current instruction.
  Table-Link linked
  (Opc() ;

: Opc  ( k*x "<NNN> ..." -- )
  \G Append a new table row for an opcode without operand parameters.

  \G When assembling an instruction, and the assembler reaches this row, it
  \G will assume the opcode is fully assembled and quits assembly of the
  \G instruction, after endcoding the opcode.
  Table-Link linked

: Opc+  ( k*x "<NNN> ..." -- )
