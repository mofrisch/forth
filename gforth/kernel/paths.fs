\ -Changing the search-path:
\ fpath+ <path> 	adds a directory to the searchpath
\ fpath= <path>|<path>	makes complete now searchpath
\ 			seperator is |
\ .fpath		displays the search path
\ remark I: 
\ a ./ in the beginning of filename is expanded to the directory the
\ current file comes from. ./ can also be included in the search-path!
\ ~+/ loads from the current working directory

\ remark II:
\ if there is no sufficient space for the search path increase it!


\ -Creating custom paths:

\ It is possible to use the search mechanism on yourself.

\ Make a buffer for the path:
\ create mypath	100 path,
\ mypath path+ 
\ mypath path=
\ mypath .path

\ do a open with the search path:
\ open-path-file ( adr len path -- fd adr len ior )
\ the file is opened read-only; if the file is not found an error is generated
