true constant count-calls? \ do some profiling of colon definitions etc.

\ for true COUNT-CALLS?:

\ What data do I need for evaluating the effectiveness of (partial) inlining?

\ static and dynamic counts of everything:

\ original BB length (histogram and average)
\ BB length with partial inlining (histogram and average)
\   since we cannot partially inline library calls, we use a parameter
\   that represents the amount of partial inlining we can expect there.
\ number of tail calls (original and after partial inlining)
\ number of calls (original and after partial inlining)
\ reason for BB end: call, return, execute, branch

\ how many static calls are there to a word?  How many of the dynamic
\ calls call just a single word?

\ Various words trigger PROFILE-THIS.  In order to avoid getting
\ several calls to PROFILE-THIS from a compiling word (like ?EXIT), we
\ just wait until the next word is parsed by the text interpreter (in
\ compile state) and call PROFILE-THIS only once then.  The whole
\ BEFORE-WORD hooking etc. is there for this.

\ The reason that we do this is because we use the source position for
\ the profiling information, and there's only one source position for
\ ?EXIT.  If we used the threaded code position instead, we would see
\ that ?EXIT compiles to several threaded-code words, and could use
\ different profile points for them.  However, usually dealing with
\ the source is more practical.

\ Another benefit is that we can ask for profiling anywhere in a
\ control-flow word (even before it compiles its own stuff).

\ Potential problem: Consider "COMPILING ] [" where COMPILING compiles
\ a whole colon definition (and triggers our profiler), but during the
\ compilation of the colon definition there is no parsing.  Afterwards
\ you get interpret state at first (no profiling, either), but after
\ the "]" you get parsing in compile state, and PROFILE-THIS gets
\ called (and compiles code that is never executed).  It would be
\ better if we had a way of knowing whether we are in a colon def or
\ not (and used that knowledge instead of STATE).
