Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice
features such as input completion and history, backtraces, a
decompiler and a powerful locals facility, and it has a comprehensive
manual. Gforth combines traditional implementation techniques with
newer techniques for portability and performance: its inner
interpreter is direct threaded with several optimizations, but you can
also use a traditional-style indirect threaded interpreter.  Gforth is
distributed under the GNU General Public license (see COPYING).

## Supported Systems

Gforth runs under GNU, BSD, and similar systems, MS Windows and MacOS X
and should not be hard to port to other systems supported by GCC. This
version has been tested successfully on the following platforms:

* GNU/Linux
  * amd64
  * arm64
  * armel
  * armhf
  * i386
  * mips
  * mipsel
  * powerpc
* Android/Linux
  * amd64
  * arm64
  * arm
  * i386
  * mips
* Gforth EC(embedded): r8c, 4stack, misc, 8086
* Windows
  * amd64
  * i386
* MacOS
  * amd64
  * i386

## Installation

Read `INSTALL` for installation instructions from tarball,\
or `INSTALL.md` for from git,\
or `INSTALL.BINDIST` if you have a binary package distributed as `.tar.xz` file.\
If you received a self-installing executable,
just run it and follow the instructions.

To start the system, just say `gforth` (after installing it).

## Download

You can find new versions of Gforth at\
[gforth.org/gforth](https://gforth.org/gforth)\
or at\
[ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gforth/](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gforth/)

## Files

On popular request, here are the meanings of unusual file extensions:

\*.fs	Forth stream source file (include with "`include _<file>_`" from within
        gforth, or start with "`gforth _<file1> <file2>_ ...`")\
\*.fi	Forth image files (start with "`gforth -i _<image file>_`")\
\*.fb	Forth blocks file (load with "`use _<block file>_ 1 load`")\
\*.i	C include files\
\*.texi.in	documenation source\
\*TAGS	etags files

A number of Forth source files are included in this package that are
not necessary for building Gforth. Not all of them are mentioned in
the rest of the documentation, so here's a short overview:

__Add-ons:__
    code.fs random.fs more.fs ansi.fs colorize.fs
    oof.fs oofsampl.fs objects.fs blocked.fb tasker.fs

__Utilities:__
    ans-report.fs etags.fs glosgen.fs filedump.fs

__Games:__
    tt.fs sokoban.fs

__Test programs (for testing Forth systems):__
    test/\*.fs

__Benchmarks:__
    bubble.fs siev.fs matrix.fs fib.fs

__ANS Forth implementations of Gforth extensions:__
    compat/\*.fs

__C-Bindings:__
