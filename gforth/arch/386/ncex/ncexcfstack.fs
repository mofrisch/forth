\ Structure of one control flow stack item
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 1 byte 	type dependent data

\ Possible types of CF stack items
0 CONSTANT CFT-orig
1 CONSTANT CFT-dest
2 CONSTANT CFT-do
3 CONSTANT CFT-colon
4 CONSTANT CFT-case
5 CONSTANT CFT-callback

\ Data format for CFT-orig
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 1 byte 	allocator state
\ 3 cells 	addr of jump distance

\ Data format for CFT-dest
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 1 byte 	allocator state
\ 3 cells 	addr of jump target

\ Data format for CFT-do
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 1 byte 	last allocator state
\ 3 cells 	a1=addr. of inner code
\ 4 cells 	a3=fix-addr for ?DO
\ 5 cells 	last-leave

\ Data format for CFT-case
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 3 cells 	count

\ LEAVEs are stored as linked lists starting at last-leave (the global
\ variable)

\ Data format for CFT-colon (host)
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 3 cells 	header address
\ 4 cells 	primitive?

\ Data format for CFT-colon (target)
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 3 cells 	header address

\ Data format for CFT-callback
\ Offset 	meaning
\ 0 		type
\ 3 cells 	header address
\ 4 cells 	return type
