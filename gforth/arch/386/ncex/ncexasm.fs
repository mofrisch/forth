\ This file implements a classical postfix assembler for Intel 386+ and based
\ on that a register allocator for the optimizer. All operations are  
\ "src dest op,"  or  "dest op," . A postfix assembler is controlled by a few
\ variables that contain information about the type of operand, its size,
\ register number and offset. One set of variables is required per possible
\ operand i.e. a CPU supports commands like "add r0,r1,r17" meaning "add the
\ contents of r1 and r17 and store the result in r0", three sets of variables
\ are used. Apart from some stranger multiplication operations the Intel 386
\ never uses more than 2 operands, further referred to as source and
\ destination. 

\ At the begin of the operation and after each stored operation a pointer has
\ to be re-set that tells the system whether the source or the destination set
\ of variables is meant with the given operand.

\ For a detailed description of the 386 and above see Intels manuals.
