\ Ring buffer handling

\ The following words provide tools to handle a finite ring buffer acting as
\ both a fifo and an array. The user of these words has to create the actual
\ data space for the buffer. 
\
\ Data is assumed to be added at the head pointer and retrieved at the tail
\ pointer. The pointer contain the index where next fetch/store has to be
\ done.
\
\ To use this file you need to define the following constants to contain the
\ exception numbers. So you can use e.g. the proposed exception word (in FLK
\ and gforth included).

\ Constant 		Meaning
\ RB-E-OVERFLOW 	Tried to advance head pointer in a full buffer.
\ RB-E-UNDERFLOW 	Tried to remove data from an empty buffer.
\ RB-E-RANGE 		Tried to access an index outside the given limit.
S" Ring buffer overflow!" exception constant RB-E-OVERFLOW
S" Ring buffer underflow!" exception constant RB-E-UNDERFLOW
S" Ring buffer index out of range!" exception constant RB-E-RANGE

\ Structure of the ring buffer record
\ Offset 	Meaning
\ 0 		Length
\ 1 Cell 	Head index
\ 2 cells 	tail index
\ 3 cells 	state ( RB-S-...)

\ States of a ring buffer. It is full, empty or none of both.
0 CONSTANT RB-S-NORMAL
1 CONSTANT RB-S-FULL
2 CONSTANT RB-S-EMPTY
