/* 31 64-bit general purpose registers R0-R30:
   R30		LR (link register)
   R29		FP (frame pointer)
   R19-R28	Callee-saved registers
   R18		The platform register; use as temporary register.
   R17		IP1 The second intra-procedure-call temporary register
		(can be used by call veneers and PLT code); otherwise use
		as a temporary register
   R16		IP0 The first intra-procedure-call temporary register (can
		be used by call veneers and PLT code); otherwise use as a
		temporary register
   R9-R15	Temporary registers
   R8		Structure value parameter / temporary register
   R0-R7	Parameter/result registers
   SP		stack pointer, encoded as X/R31 where permitted.
   ZR		zero register, encoded as X/R31 elsewhere
   32 x 128-bit floating-point/vector registers
   V16-V31	Caller-saved (temporary) registers
   V8-V15	Callee-saved registers
   V0-V7	Parameter/result registers
   The vector register V0 holds scalar B0, H0, S0 and D0 in its least
   significant bits.  Unlike AArch32 S1 is not packed into D0,
   etc.  */
